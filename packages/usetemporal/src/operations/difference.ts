/**
 * Calculate the difference (gap) between two periods or dates
 *
 * This function calculates the time span between two temporal points.
 * When given two periods, it returns the gap between them.
 * When given dates, it returns the span from one to the other.
 *
 * @param adapter - The adapter instance
 * @param from - Starting period or date
 * @param to - Ending period or date
 * @returns A custom period representing the difference/gap
 *
 * @example
 * // Gap between two months
 * const jan = period(adapter, new Date(2024, 0, 15), "month");
 * const march = period(adapter, new Date(2024, 2, 15), "month");
 * const gap = difference(adapter, jan, march);
 * // Returns February as a custom period
 *
 * @example
 * // Duration between two dates
 * const start = new Date(2024, 0, 1);
 * const end = new Date(2024, 0, 10);
 * const duration = difference(adapter, start, end);
 * // Returns 9-day custom period from Jan 1 to Jan 10
 *
 * @example
 * // Reversed order is normalized (start <= end always)
 * const later = new Date(2024, 0, 10);
 * const earlier = new Date(2024, 0, 1);
 * const span = difference(adapter, later, earlier);
 * // Returns period from Jan 1 to Jan 10 (same as forward)
