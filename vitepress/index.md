## Quick Start

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @allystudio/usetemporal
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @allystudio/usetemporal
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @allystudio/usetemporal
```

:::

```ts
import { period, divide } from '@allystudio/usetemporal/operations'
import { createNativeAdapter } from '@allystudio/usetemporal/native'

const adapter = createNativeAdapter({ weekStartsOn: 1 })

const year = period(adapter, new Date(), 'year')
const months = divide(adapter, year, 'month')
const days = divide(adapter, months[0], 'day')
```

## Why useTemporal?

- **Better mental model** – think in terms of years, months, weeks, and days instead of brittle date arithmetic.
- **Plain data structures** – everything is a simple object, so rendering in any UI is straightforward.
- **Composable** – extend the hierarchy as far as you need by repeatedly calling `divide()`.
