# Angular Integration (Roadmap)

Angular support lands after Vue/React parity wraps. The planned package
`@allystudio/usetemporal-angular` focuses on:

- An injectable `TemporalService` exposing `signal`-based `browsing` and `now`.
- Structural directives (e.g., `*ustWeek`, `*ustDay`) for iterating divided
  periods directly in templates.
- Utility functions for hooking the builder into control-flow blocks or
  standalone components.

Keep an eye on the roadmap—APIs will mirror other frameworks so business logic
stays portable.
