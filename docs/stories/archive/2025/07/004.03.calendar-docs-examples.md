## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Examples should be runnable and testable
- Include unit tests for example code
- Ensure examples work with latest core version

### Context
- Build on existing stable month calendar example
- Show clear improvement over manual approach
- Focus on real-world calendar use cases
- Consider international users (different week starts, locales)

### Documentation Structure

```

### Key Documentation Points
- Why separate package (reference architecture decision)
- How stableMonth differs from regular month
- Integration with existing temporal instances
- Styling considerations for fixed grids
- Accessibility notes for calendar navigation
