# Story 004.04: Remove StableMonth from Core

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** library maintainer,
**I want** to remove stableMonth references from the core package,
**so that** the core remains focused on fundamental time operations without calendar-specific concerns.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. StableMonth type removed from UnitRegistry interface
2. StableMonth constant removed from UNITS object and individual exports
3. All stableMonth references removed from core type definitions
4. Any stableMonth-related tests removed or disabled
5. Build and type checking pass without stableMonth
6. No breaking changes for other unit types
7. Migration notes added for any removed functionality

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Remove from type definitions (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Remove `stableMonth: true` from UnitRegistry in types.ts
  - [x] Remove from Unit type union (AdapterUnit exclude)
  - [x] Check for any other type references
- [x] Remove from constants (AC: 2)
  - [x] Remove from UNITS object
  - [x] Remove STABLE_MONTH individual export
  - [x] Update constants tests
- [x] Clean up tests (AC: 4)
  - [x] Search for stableMonth in all test files
  - [x] Remove or comment out stableMonth-specific tests
  - [x] Update any test fixtures using stableMonth
- [x] Verify build integrity (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Run full build
  - [x] Run type checking
  - [x] Run all tests
  - [x] Verify no runtime errors
- [x] Document removal (AC: 7)
  - [x] Add note to MIGRATION.md
  - [x] Create migration note with examples
  - [x] No docs found referencing stableMonth in core

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Ensure all remaining tests pass
- Verify type exports don't include stableMonth
- Check that build outputs are clean

### Context
- StableMonth was added to types but never implemented
- Moving to separate calendar-units package per architecture decision
- This is cleanup to prevent confusion about where this unit lives

### Files to Check
- `/packages/core/src/types.ts` - Remove from line 33 and constants
- `/packages/core/src/index.ts` - Check exports
- `/packages/core/src/constants.test.ts` - Remove from tests
- Any other files found via grep for "stableMonth"

### Important Considerations
- This is a breaking change if anyone is using the stableMonth type
- However, since it was never implemented, impact should be minimal
- Coordinate with release notes
