### Comparison Table Format
| Adapter | Bundle Size | Ops/sec | Tree-shakeable | Timezone | Immutable | Status |
|---------|------------|---------|----------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Native | 0KB | 1M+ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Stable |
| date-fns | 2.1KB | 800K | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Stable |
| Luxon | 2.3KB | 400K | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Stable |
| etc... |

### Selection Guide Structure
1. **Do you need timezone support?**
   - Yes → Luxon, Temporal, date-fns-tz
   - No → Continue
   
2. **What's your bundle size budget?**
   - <1KB → Native
   - <3KB → date-fns, Day.js
   - 3KB+ → Any adapter

3. **Are you migrating from another library?**
   - Moment.js → Use Moment adapter first
   - etc...

### Performance Metrics
- Measure common operations (create, add, diff)
- Use consistent benchmarking approach
- Test on multiple environments
- Include methodology notes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-26
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
**EXCELLENT** - The adapter documentation implementation exceeds expectations. All acceptance criteria have been fully met with comprehensive, well-structured documentation that provides exceptional value to developers.

### Implementation Review

#### What Was Delivered:
1. **Comprehensive Comparison Table** ✅
   - Bundle sizes with min+gzip measurements
   - Performance metrics (operations/second)
   - Feature matrix covering all capabilities
   - Clear visual comparison

2. **Interactive Selection Guide** ✅
   - Mermaid flowchart for decision flow
   - Use case scenarios (SaaS, Mobile, CMS, Enterprise)
   - Project type recommendations
   - Migration considerations

3. **Detailed Migration Guide** ✅
   - Migration paths from all major date libraries
   - Code examples showing before/after
   - Gradual migration strategies
   - Performance migration tips

4. **Individual Adapter Guides** ✅
   - Comprehensive guides for each adapter
   - When to use recommendations
   - Pros/cons clearly listed
   - Installation and quick start examples

5. **README Updates** ✅
   - Adapter comparison table added
   - Link to comprehensive documentation
   - Migration guide reference
   - Clear adapter deprecation notice

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✅ Documentation follows project markdown standards
- Project Structure: ✅ Follows proposed structure exactly
- Testing Strategy: N/A (documentation only)
- All ACs Met: ✅ All 8 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Exceptional Work:
1. **Performance Benchmarks**: Actual ops/second measurements provided
2. **Decision Flow Diagram**: Interactive Mermaid chart makes selection intuitive
3. **Migration Patterns**: Comprehensive examples from vanilla JS and all major libraries
4. **Trade-off Analysis**: Clear performance vs features visualization
5. **Use Case Matrix**: Real-world scenarios mapped to adapter choices

### Minor Observations:
1. Some adapter links reference deprecated package names (already noted for migration)
2. Interactive playground link mentioned but not implemented (nice-to-have)

### Security Review
No security concerns - documentation only.

### Performance Considerations
Documentation is well-organized and loads efficiently. Mermaid diagrams render quickly.

### Final Status
✅ **Approved - Ready for Done**

This is exemplary documentation work that provides tremendous value to developers evaluating and using useTemporal. The implementation not only meets all requirements but adds thoughtful extras like the decision flowchart and use case matrices that will significantly improve developer experience.
