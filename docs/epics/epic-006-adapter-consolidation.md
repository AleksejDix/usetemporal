# Epic 006: Adapter Consolidation and Architecture Improvement

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: 006  
**Epic Name**: Adapter Consolidation and Architecture Improvement  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Target Completion**: 2025-07-30  
**Sprint**: Adapter Consolidation Sprint (July 2025)  

## Epic Description
Consolidate all adapter packages into the core package to improve maintainability, coverage tracking, and build performance. This architectural change will simplify the monorepo structure while maintaining clean separation through entry points and enabling better tree-shaking for consumers.

## Business Value
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Simpler dependency management and clearer project structure
- **Accurate Coverage Metrics**: All adapter code tested and reported in one place
- **Better Performance**: Reduced build complexity and improved tree-shaking
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single location for all adapter implementations

## Technical Goals
1. Move all adapter implementations into core package under src/adapters/
2. Create separate entry points for each adapter to maintain clean imports
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing import paths
4. Improve test coverage visibility and accuracy
5. Reduce monorepo complexity and build times

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All adapters consolidated into core package
- [ ] Coverage reporting shows actual adapter test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] No breaking changes for existing consumers
- [ ] Build time reduced by at least 20%
- [ ] Documentation updated with new import patterns

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies
- Requires coordination with any active development

## Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Need to ensure all imports are updated correctly
- **Breaking Changes**: Risk of breaking existing consumer code
- **Build Configuration**: May require updates to build tools and configs

- Should be completed in a focused sprint to minimize disruption
- Consider creating a migration guide for external consumers

## Sprint Planning - Adapter Consolidation Sprint

**Sprint Dates**: July 26-30, 2025 (3 days)  
**Stories in Sprint**: 8 of 9 stories (006.08 deferred for user migration period)

### Day-by-Day Plan:
- **Day 1**: Foundation (006.01) + Native/Temporal adapters (006.02, 006.03)
- **Day 2**: Luxon/Date-fns (006.04, 006.05) + Entry points (006.06)
- **Day 3**: Update imports/tests (006.07) + Documentation (006.09)

### Key Deliverables:
1. All adapters available from `@usetemporal/core`
2. Clean entry points for tree-shaking
3. Accurate coverage metrics (80%+ target)
4. Complete migration guide
5. Backward compatibility maintained

### Success Metrics:
- 20%+ bundle size reduction with single adapter
- Zero breaking changes for users
- All 688+ tests passing
- Clear documentation and examples
