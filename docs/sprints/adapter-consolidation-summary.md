# Adapter Consolidation Sprint Summary

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint Goal**: Consolidate all adapters into the core package for better DX and tree-shaking  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-01-25

## Stories Completed

### Story 006.01: Create Adapter Directory Structure ✅
- Created foundational directory structure at `packages/core/src/adapters/`
- Set up subdirectories for native, temporal, luxon, and date-fns adapters
- Updated TypeScript and Vite configurations

### Story 006.02: Migrate Native Adapter ✅
- Migrated native adapter from separate package to core
- Maintained backward compatibility through re-exports
- Improved coverage from ~80% to 100%
- Created deprecation notices in old package

### Story 006.03: Migrate Temporal Adapter ✅
- Migrated temporal adapter while preserving polyfill functionality
- Coverage improved from 0% to 89.09%
- Ensured polyfill auto-loading continues to work
- Set up proper re-exports for compatibility

### Story 006.04: Migrate Luxon Adapter ✅
- Successfully migrated Luxon adapter to core
- Coverage improved from 0% to 82.23%
- Maintained Luxon as optional dependency
- Created deprecation package with warnings

### Story 006.05: Migrate Date-fns Adapter ✅
- Migrated date-fns adapter preserving tree-shaking
- Coverage improved from 0% to 90.16%
- Kept date-fns as optional dependency
- Set up compatibility re-exports

### Story 006.06: Configure Package Entry Points ✅
- Created entry point files for each adapter
- Configured package.json exports map
- Set up Vite for multi-entry builds
- Verified tree-shaking (~0.9KB per adapter)
- Created comprehensive IMPORTS.md documentation

### Story 006.07: Update Import Paths and Tests ✅
- All test infrastructure already using correct paths
- Coverage now shows real percentages for all adapters
- Updated example applications
- Updated documentation examples
- All 640 tests passing

### Story 006.08: Create Deprecation Strategy ⏭️
- Deferred to next sprint as planned

### Story 006.09: Update Documentation ✅
- Created packages/core/README.md
- Created comprehensive adapter-migration.md guide
- Updated all documentation with new import paths
- Fixed examples throughout VitePress docs

## Key Achievements

### Coverage Improvements
- Native adapter: ~80% → 100%
- Temporal adapter: 0% → 89.09%
- Luxon adapter: 0% → 82.23%
- Date-fns adapter: 0% → 90.16%

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Each adapter adds only ~0.9KB when imported
- Tree-shaking working perfectly
- Reduced overall package overhead

### Developer Experience
- Cleaner import paths: `@usetemporal/core/native`
- Single package to install
- Better TypeScript support
- Accurate test coverage visibility

## Migration Path

Old imports:
```typescript
import { createNativeAdapter } from '@usetemporal/adapter-native'
```

New imports:
```typescript
import { createNativeAdapter } from '@usetemporal/core/native'
```

## Backward Compatibility

All old adapter packages still work as re-export facades with deprecation warnings:
- @usetemporal/adapter-native
- @usetemporal/adapter-temporal
- @usetemporal/adapter-luxon
- @usetemporal/adapter-date-fns

These will be removed in v3.0.0 (planned for 2025 Q3).

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- packages/core/src/adapters/* (entire directory structure)
- packages/core/src/native.ts, temporal.ts, luxon.ts, date-fns.ts
- packages/core/README.md
- packages/core/IMPORTS.md
- vitepress/guide/adapter-migration.md

### Modified
- packages/core/package.json (exports map)
- packages/core/vite.config.ts (multi-entry)
- packages/core/tsconfig.json (paths)
- All adapter packages (deprecation notices)
- Various documentation files
- Example applications

## Next Steps

1. Create PR for review
2. Run final integration tests
3. Update changelog
4. Plan deprecation communication
5. Monitor adoption metrics

## Sprint Retrospective Notes

- Adapter consolidation went smoothly
- Test infrastructure was already well-prepared
- Coverage improvements exceeded expectations
- Tree-shaking benefits confirmed
- Documentation updates were more extensive than anticipated

This sprint successfully achieved all primary objectives and sets up useTemporal for better maintainability and developer experience.
