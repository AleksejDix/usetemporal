# Adapter Consolidation Sprint - July 2025

## Sprint Information
- **Sprint Name**: Adapter Consolidation Sprint
- **Sprint Goal**: Consolidate all adapters into core package for better DX and performance
- **Start Date**: 2025-07-26 (Friday)
- **End Date**: 2025-07-30 (Tuesday) - 3 working days
- **Team Capacity**: 1 Developer Agent

## Sprint Context
Following the successful Quality Enhancement Sprint, this sprint focuses on a major architectural improvement that will benefit all users:
1. Simpler imports with better tree-shaking
2. Accurate coverage metrics for better quality assurance
3. Reduced bundle sizes and faster builds
4. Automatic polyfill loading where needed

## User Value Delivered
- **Before**: `npm install @usetemporal/core @usetemporal/adapter-native`
- **After**: `npm install @usetemporal/core` (all adapters included!)
- **Bundle Size**: Only imports what you use - better tree-shaking
- **DX Improvement**: Cleaner, more intuitive imports
- **Reliability**: Better tested adapters with visible coverage

## Daily Plan

### Day 1 - Friday 2025-07-26
**Morning (2-3 hours)**
- Story 006.01: Set up new adapter directory structure
- Create proper TypeScript configuration
- Ensure build system ready

**Afternoon (4-5 hours)**
- Story 006.02: Migrate Native adapter (simplest)
- Story 006.03: Migrate Temporal adapter (includes polyfill)
- Verify both work with existing tests

### Day 2 - Monday 2025-07-29
**Morning (4 hours)**
- Story 006.04: Migrate Luxon adapter
- Story 006.05: Migrate Date-fns adapter
- Ensure peer dependencies handled correctly

**Afternoon (3-4 hours)**
- Story 006.06: Configure all entry points
- Set up proper exports in package.json
- Test tree-shaking with example app

### Day 3 - Tuesday 2025-07-30
**Morning (3-4 hours)**
- Story 006.07: Update all imports and tests
- Verify coverage now shows real percentages
- Run full test suite

**Afternoon (3 hours)**
- Story 006.09: Update all documentation
- Create migration guide for users
- Update examples and README

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All adapters consolidated into core package
- [ ] Coverage shows real percentages (>80% for adapters)
- [ ] All 688+ tests passing
- [ ] Tree-shaking verified with bundle analysis
- [ ] Documentation updated with migration guide
- [ ] No breaking changes for existing imports (backward compatible)

## Success Metrics
- Bundle size reduction of at least 20% when using single adapter
- Coverage visibility for all adapters (no more 0%)
- All existing imports continue to work
- New imports are cleaner and more intuitive
- Migration guide helps users adopt new structure

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Import Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
2. **Build Complexity**: Test thoroughly in different environments
3. **User Confusion**: Clear migration guide and examples
4. **Performance Regression**: Benchmark before and after

## Sprint Deliverables for Users
1. **Cleaner Imports**:
   ```typescript
   // New way - much cleaner!
   import { createTemporal } from '@usetemporal/core'
   import { createNativeAdapter } from '@usetemporal/core/native'
   ```

2. **Better Tree-Shaking**: Only bundle the adapter you use

3. **Automatic Polyfills**: Temporal adapter includes polyfill automatically

4. **Migration Guide**: Step-by-step guide for existing users

5. **Improved Documentation**: Clear examples for all adapters

## Notes
- This is a high-impact architectural change that benefits all users
- Focus on backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing apps
- The improved DX will make the library more attractive to new users
- Sets foundation for future features like custom adapters
