    status: PASS
    notes: "Bundle size reduced from ~15-20KB to 2.87KB gzipped (87% reduction). Exceeds 8KB target."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 679 tests passing. Multi-adapter testing validates reliability across date libraries."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS

      refs: ["Story 011.03"]
      note: "Restore reactive functionality for Vue ecosystem"

strengths:
  - "Exceptional test coverage maintained (679 tests, all passing)"
  - "Bundle size reduction far exceeds target (2.87KB vs 8KB goal)"
  - "Zero breaking changes to core pure function API"
  - "Clean file management strategy (.removed extension for future use)"
  - "Type safety fully preserved with no TypeScript errors"
  - "Multi-adapter pattern ensures reliability across date libraries"
  - "Well-documented completion notes in Dev Agent Record"

observations:
  - "Test count reduced from 722 to 679 (43 reactive tests removed) - appropriate and expected"
  - "TemporalContext interface retained for pure operations - good design decision"
  - "Builder.ts and related files properly identified and removed despite not being in original story"
  - "Package keywords updated to reflect framework-agnostic nature"
