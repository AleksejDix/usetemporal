# Recommendations for continuous improvement
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "Add 'Migration from v1.x' sections to each type documentation file"
      refs: ["vitepress/api/types/*.md"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Would help users transitioning from older versions"

      refs: ["vitepress/api/types/index.md"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Improves discoverability and user navigation"
    - action: "Set up TypeScript compilation check for documentation code blocks"
      refs: ["CI/CD pipeline"]
      priority: "medium"
      rationale: "Ensures all code examples remain compilable as API evolves"
